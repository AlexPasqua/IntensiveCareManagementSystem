# Intensive Care Management System

<font size=4>***Software Engineering* practice project for UniVR**</font><br>
<font size=4>Developed by Alex Pasquali, Francesco Fattori, Giacomo Frigo</font>

## Description:

<p>
	<font size=3>
		This project was developed as practice project for the course of <i>Programmazione II e Ingegneria del Software</i> (Software Engineering) @ University of Verona (UniVR)<br>
		<u>NOTE: the application's language is Italian</u>
	</font>
</p>


<p>
	<font size=4><b>Functioning:</b></font><br>
	With this application it's possible to register new hospitalizations and manage them.<br>
	When registering a new patient, it's possible to enter all his/her personal data (name, ID code, date of birth...) and insert a diagnosis.<br>
	In the home page are shown the hospitalized patient with some graphs of their vital functions. <br>
	The medical data are automatically generated by a process called <i>MonitoringSystem</i>
</p>

<p>
	For every patient, it's possible to: <br>
	&emsp;- See <b>pression</b>, <b>heart beat</b> and <b>temperature</b> graphs <br>
	&emsp;- Enter medical prescriptions and administrations <br>
	&emsp;- Release the patient from hospitalization and generate a final report (printable in pdf)
</p>


To **login** go to *File* -> *Login*<br>
There are 3 levels of permissions: **nurse**, **doctor** and **chief doctor**.<br>
**Nurse** <font face="consolas">(user: nurse | pwd: nurse):</font>
it's possible to add a new patient, add medical administrations and see a list of the patients with their data.

**Doctor** <font face="consolas">(user: doctor | pwd: doctor):</font>
It has all nurse's permission plus the possibility to add prescriptions and insert diagnosis in the system.

**Chief doctor** <font face="consolas">(user: admin | pwd: admin):</font>
It has all doctor's permission plus the possibility to add new users (belonging to these 3 categories), releasing patients and generate reports.

## IDE configuration:
### Intellij IDEA:

NOTE: the IDE's version used by the developer is 2019.1.3

**Setting the SDK:** Go to File / Project Structure / Project: select a SDK (*recommended* 11 <font color="gray">(java version "11.0.2")</font>) and a language level (*recommended* SDK default <font color="gray">(11 - Local varaible syntax for lambda parameters)</font>).

**Set compiler output directory:** Go to File / Project Structure / Project: select a directory for "Project compiler output".<br>
You can just create a special "out" directory inside your project folder. I suggest to add it in .gitignore file.

**Libraries:** <u>Needed libraries</u>: javafx-sdk - itext - slf4j
<font color="gray">
	(we used javafx-sdk-<b>11.0.2</b>, itext<b>7</b> and slf4j-<b>1.7.26</b>)
</font>
<br>
Go to File / Project Structure / Libraries: add the following by clicking on the **+** symbol and selecting "*Java*":
<br>
- <font color="black">JavaFX SDK:</font> select the path to javafx-sdk-X.X.X/**lib**<br>
- <font color="black">itext:</font> select the path to itextX (the final "X" is the version)<br>
- <font color="black">slf4j:</font> select the path to slf4j-X.X.X/slf4j-api-X.X.X.jar **and** slf4j-X.X.X/slf4j-simple-X.X.X.jar

**Add configuration:** <br>
- New (<b>+</b>) Application <br>
- VM options: --module-path "<font color="gray">PATH-TO-FX</font>" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml <br>
- Main class: therapy.Main <br>
- Name: Main (or whatever) <br>
- click Apply <br>
- New (<b>+</b>) Application <br>
- Main class: therapy.MonitoringSystem <br>
- Name: MonitoringSystem (or whatever) <br>
- click OK
