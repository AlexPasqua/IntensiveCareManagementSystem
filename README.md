	<font size=4><b>Functioning:</b></font><br>
	With this application it's possible to register new hospitalizations and manage them.<br>
	When registering a new patient, it's possible to enter all his/her personal data (name, ID code, date of birth...) and insert a diagnosis.<br>
	In the home page are shown the hospitalized patient with some graphs of their vital functions. <br>
	The medical data are automatically generated by a process called <i>MonitoringSystem</i>
</p>

<p>
	For every patient, it's possible to: <br>
	&emsp;- See <b>pression</b>, <b>heart beat</b> and <b>temperature</b> graphs <br>
	&emsp;- Enter medical prescriptions and administrations <br>
	&emsp;- Release the patient from hospitalization and generate a final report (printable in pdf)
